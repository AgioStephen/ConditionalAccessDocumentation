# Document Conditional Access with PowerShell and the Microsoft.Graph module

This PowerShell script adapts functionality from the [Modern Workplace Concierge](https://github.com/nicolonsky/ModernWorkplaceConcierge) to document your Conditional Access Policies with PowerShell and create a human readable documentation.

This script requires the ```Microsoft.Graph``` PowerShell module. You can install it directly from the PowerShell Gallery via:
```Install-Module -Name Microsoft.Graph```.
